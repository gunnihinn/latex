\section{Linear algebra}


\subsection{Fields}


A field is a set of elements in which a pair of operations called multiplication and addition is defined analogous to the operations of multiplication and addition in the real number system (which is itself an example of a field).
In each field $F$ there exist unique elements called 0 and 1 which, under the opreations of addition and multiplication, behave with respect to all the other elements of $F$ exactly as their correspondents in the real number sysem.
In two respects, the analogy is not complete: 1) multiplication is not assumed to be commutative in every field, and 2) a field may have only a finite number of elements.

More exactly, a field is a set of elements which, under the above mentioned operation of addition, forms an additive abelian group and for which the elements, exclusive of zero, form a multiplicative group and, finally, in which the two group operations are connected by the distributive law.
Furthermore, the prodct of 0 and any element is defined to be 0.

If multiplication in the field is commutative, then the field is called a commutative field.


\subsection{Vector spaces}

If $V$ is an additive abelian group with elements $A$, $B$, $\ldots$, $F$ a field with elements $a$, $b$, $\ldots$, and if for each $a \in F$ and $A \in V$ the product $aA$ denotes an element of $V$, then $V$ is called a \emph{(left) vector space over $F$} if the following assumptions hold:

\begin{enumerate}
\item
a(A + B) = aA + aB

\item
(a + b)A = aA + bA

\item
a(bA) = (ab) A

\item
1A = A
\end{enumerate}

The reader may readily verify that if $V$ is a vector space over $F$, then $oA = 0$ and $a0 = 0$ where $o$ is the zero element of $F$ and $0$ that of $V$.
For example, the first relation follows from the equations:
\[
aA = (a + o)A = aA + oA
\]

Sometimes product between elements of $F$ and $V$ are written in the form $Aa$ in which case $V$ is called a \emph{right vector space over $F$} to distinguish it from the previous case where multiplication by field elements is from the left.
If, in the discussion, left and right vector spaces do not occur simultaneously, we shall simply use the term ``vector space''.


\subsection{Homogeneous linear equations}

If in a field $F$, $a_{ij}$, $i = 1,2,\ldots,m$, $j = 1,2,\ldots,n$ are $m \cdot n$ elements, it is frequently necessary to know conditions guaranteeing the existence of elements in $F$ such that the following equations are satisfied:
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:on}
\begin{aligned}
a_{11} x_1 + a_{12} x_2 + \cdots + a_{1n} x_n &= 0,
\\
\vdots &
\\
a_{m1} x_1 + a_{m2} x_2 + \cdots + a_{mn} x_n &= 0.
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}
The reader will recall that such equations are called \emph{linear homogeneous equations}, and a set of elements $x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n$ of $F$, for which all the above equations are true, is called a solution of the system.
If not all of the elements $x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n$ are $0$ the solution is called \emph{non-trivial}; otherwise it is called \emph{trivial}.


\begin{theo}
\label{theo:on}
A system of linear homogeneous equations always as a non-trivial solution if the number of unknowns exceeds the number of equations.
\end{theo}


The proof of this follows the method familiar to most high school students, namely, successive elimination of unknowns.
If no equations in $n > 0$ variables are prescribed, then our unknowns are unrestricted and we may set them all $= 1$.

We shall proceed by complete induction.
Let us suppose that each system of $k$ equations in more than $k$ unknowns has a non-trivial solution when $k < m$.
In the system of equations~\eqref{eq:on} we assume that $n > m$, and denote the expression $a_{i1} x_1 + \ldots + a_{in} x_n$ by $L_i$, $i = 1,2,\ldots,m$.
We seek elements $x_1, \ldots, x_n$ not all $0$ such that $L_1 = L_2 = \cdots = L_m = 0$.
If $a_{ij} = 0$ for each $i$ and $j$, then any choice of $x_1, \ldots, x_n$ will serve as a solution.
If not all $a_{ij}$ are 0, then we may assume that $a_{11} \not= 0$, for the order in which the equations are written or in which the unknowns are numbered has no influence on the existence of non-existence of a simultaneous solution.
We can find a non-trivial solution to our given system of equations, if and only if we can find a non-trivial solution to the following system:
\begin{align*}
L_1 &= 0
\\
L_2 - a_{21} a_{11}^{-1} L_1 &= 0
\\
&\vdots
\\
L_m - a_{m1} a_{11}^{-1} L_1 &= 0
\end{align*}
For, if $x_1, \ldots, x_n$ is a solution of these latter equations then, since $L_1 = 0$, the second term in each of the remaining equations is 0 and, hence, $L_2 = L_3 = \cdots = L_m = 0$.
Conversely, if \eqref{eq:on} is satisfied, then the new system is clearly satisfied.
The reader will notice that the new system was set up in such a way as to ``eliminate'' $x_1$ from the last $m-1$ equations.
Furthermore, if a non-trivial solution of the last $m-1$ equations, when viewed as equations in $x_2, \ldots, x_n$, exists then taking $x_1 = -a_{11}^{-1}(a_{12} x_2 + a_{13} x_3 + \cdots + a_{1n} x_n)$ would give us a solution to the whole system.
However, the last $m-1$ equations have a solution by our inductive assumption, from which the theorem follows.


\begin{rema}
If the linear homogeneous equations had been written in the form $\sum x_j a_{ij} = 0$, $j = 1, 2, \ldots, n$, the above theorem would still hold and with the same proof although with the order in which terms are written changed in a few instances.
\end{rema}



\subsection{Dependence and independence of vectors}

In a vector space $V$ over a field $F$, the vectors $A_1, \ldots, A_n$ are called \emph{dependent} if there exist elements $x_1, \ldots, x_n$, not all $0$, of $F$ such that $x_1 A_1 + x_2 A_2 + \cdots + x_n A_n = 0$.
If the vectors $A_1, \ldots A_n$ are not dependent, they are called \emph{independent}.

The \emph{dimension} of a vector space $V$ over a field $F$ is the maximum number of independent elements in $V$. Thus, the dimension of $V$ is $n$ if there are $n$ independent elements in $V$, but no set of more than $n$ independent elements.

A system $A_1, \ldots, A_m$ of elements in $V$ is called a \emph{generating system} of $V$ if each elment $A$ of $V$ can be expressed linearly in terms of $A_1, \ldots, A_m$, i.e., $A = \sum_{i = 1}^m a_i A_i$ for a suitable choice of $a_i$, $i = 1,\ldots, m$, in $F$.


\begin{theo}
\label{theo:tw}
In any generating system the maximum number of independent vectors is equal to the dimension of the vector space.
\end{theo}

Let $A_1, \ldots, A_m$ be a generating system of a vector space $V$ of dimension $n$.
Let $r$ be the maximum number of independent elements in the generating system.
By a suitable reordering of the generators we may assume $A_1, \dots, A_r$ independent.
By the definition of dimension it follows that $r \leq n$.
For each $j$, $A_1, \ldots, A_r, A_{r+j}$ are dependent, and in the relation
\[
a_1 A_1 + a_2 A_2 + \cdots + a_r A_r + a_{r+j} A_{r+j} = 0
\]
expressing this, $a_{r+j} \not=0$, for the contrary would assert the dependence of $A_1, \ldots, A_r$.
Thus,
\[
A_{r+j} = -a_{r+j}^{-1}(a_1 A_1 + a_2 A_2 + \cdots + a_r A_r).
\]
It follows that $A_1, \ldots, A_r$ is also a generating system since in the linear relation for any element of $V$ the terms involving $A_{r+j}$, $j\not=0$, can all be replaced by linear expressions in $A_1, \ldots, A_r$.

Now, let $B_1, \ldots B_t$ be any system of vectors in $V$ where $t > r$, then there exists $a_{ij}$ such that $B_j = \sum_{i=1}^r a_{ij} A_i$, $j=1,2,\dots,t$, since the $A_i$'s form a generating system.
If we can show that $B_1, \ldots, B_t$ are dependent, this will give us $r \geq n$, and the theorem will follow from this together with the previous inequality $r \leq n$.
Thus, we must exhibit the existence of a non-trivial solution of $F$ of the equation
\[
x_1 B_1 + x_2 B_2 + \cdots + x_t B_t = 0.
\]
To this end, it will be sufficient to choose the $x_i$'s so as to satisfy the linear equations $\sum_{j=1}^t x_j a_{ij} = 0$, $i = 1,2,\dots,r$, since these expressions will be the coefficients of $A_i$ when in $\sum_{j=1}^t x_j B_j$ the $B_j$'s are replaced by $\sum_{i=1}^r a_{ij} A_i$ and terms are collected.
A solution to the equations $\sum_{j=1}^t x_j a_{ij} = 0$, $i = 1,2,\ldots,r$ always exists by Theorem~\ref{theo:on}.


\begin{rema}
Any $n$ independent vectors $A_1, \ldots, A_n$ in an $n$ dimensional vector space form a generating system.
For any vector $A$, the vectors $A, A_1, \ldots, A_n$ are dependent and the coefficient of $A$, in the dependence relation, cannot be zero.
Solving for $A$ in terms of $A_1, \ldots, A_n$, exhibits $A_1, \ldots, A_n$ as a generating system.
\end{rema}


A subset of a vector space is called a \emph{subspace} if it is a subgroup of the vector space and if, in addition, the multiplication of any element in the subset by any element in the field is also in the subset.
If $A_1, \ldots, a_n$ are elements on a vector space $V$, then the set of all elements of the form $a_1 A_1 + \ldots + a_n A_n$ clearly forms a subspace of $V$.
It is also evident, from the definition of dimension, that the dimension of any subspace never exceeds the dimension of the whole vector space.

An $s$-tuple of elements $(a_1, \ldots, a_s)$ in a field $F$ will be called a \emph{row vector}.
The totality of such $s$-tuple for a vector space if we define

$\alpha$)
$(a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_s) = (b_1, b_2, \ldots, b_s)$ if and only if $a_i = b_i$, $i = 1, \ldots, s$,

$\beta$)
$(a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_s) + (b_1, b_2, \ldots, b_s)
= (a_1 + b_1, a_2 + b_2, \ldots, a_s + b_2)$,

$\gamma$)
$b (a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_s) = (ba_1, ba_2, \ldots, ba_s)$, for $b$ an element of $F$.

When the $s$-tuples are written vertically,
\[
\begin{pmatrix}
a_1 \\ \vdots \\ a_s
\end{pmatrix}
\]
they will be called \emph{column vectors}.


\begin{theo}
\label{theo:th}
The row (column) vector space $F^n$ of all $n$-tuples from a field $F$ is a vector space of dimension $n$ over $F$.
\end{theo}

The $n$ elements
\begin{align*}
\eps_1 &= (1, 0, 0, \ldots, 0)
\\
\eps_2 &= (0, 1, 0, \ldots, 0)
\\
       & \vdots 
\\
\eps_n &= (0, 0, 0, \ldots, 1)
\end{align*}
are independent and generate $F^n$.
Both remarks follow from the relation $(a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n) = \sum a_i \eps_i$.


We call a rectangular array
\[
\begin{pmatrix}
a_{11} & a_{12} & \ldots & a_{1n}
\\
a_{21} & a_{22} & \ldots & a_{2n}
\\
\vdots & \vdots & \ddots & \vdots
\\
a_{m1} & a_{m2} & \ldots & a_{mn}
\end{pmatrix}
\]
of elements of a field $F$ a \emph{matrix}.
By the \emph{right row rank} of a matrix, we mean the maximum number of independent row vectors among the rows $(a_{i1}, \ldots, a_{in})$ of the matrix when multiplication by field elements is from the right.
Similarly, we define left row rank, right column rank and left column rank.


\begin{theo}
\label{theo:fo}
In any matrix the right column rank equals the left row rank and the left rolumn rank equals the right row rank.
If the field is commutative, these four numbers are equal to each other and are called the rank of the matrix.
\end{theo}


Call the column vectors of the matrix $C_1, \ldots, C_n$ and the row vectors $R_1, \ldots, R_m$.
The column vector $0$ is
\[
\begin{pmatrix}
0 \\ 0 \\ \vdots \\ 0
\end{pmatrix}
\]
and any dependence $C_1 x_1 + C_2 x_2 + \cdots + C_n x_n = 0$ is equivalent to a solution of the equations
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:Don}
\begin{aligned}
a_{11}x_1 + a_{12}x_2 + \cdots + a_{1n}x_n &= 0
\\
\vdots &
\\
a_{m1}x_1 + a_{m2}x_2 + \cdots + a_{mn}x_n &= 0.
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}
Any change in the order in which the rows of the matrix are written gives rise to the same system of equations and, hence, does not change the column rank of the matrix, but also does not change the row rank since the changed matrix would have the same set of row vectors.
Call $c$ the right column rank and $r$ the left row rank of the matrix.
By the above remarks we may assume that the first $r$ rows are independent row vectors.
The row vector space generated by all the rows of the matrix has, by Theorem~\ref{theo:on}, the dimension $r$ and is even generated by the first $r$ rows.
Thus, each row after the $r^{\text{th}}$ is linearly expressable in terms of the first $r$ rows.
Consequently, any solution of the first $r$ equations in \eqref{eq:Don} will be a solution of the entire system since any of the last $n-r$ equations is obtainable as a linear combination of the first $r$.
Conversely, any solution of \eqref{eq:Don} will also be a solution of the first $r$ equations.
This means that the matrix
\[
\begin{pmatrix}
a_{11} & a_{12} & \ldots & a_{1n}
\\
a_{21} & a_{22} & \ldots & a_{2n}
\\
\vdots & \vdots & \ddots & \vdots
\\
a_{r1} & a_{r2} & \ldots & a_{rn}
\end{pmatrix}
\]
consisting of the first $r$ rows of the original matrix has the same right column rank as the original.
It also has the same left row rank since the $r$ rows were chosen independent.
But the column rank of the amputated matrix cannot exceed $r$ by Theorem~\ref{theo:th}.
Hence, $c \leq r$.
Similarly, calling $c'$ the left column rank and $r'$ the right column rank, $c' \leq r'$.

If we form the transpose of the original matrix, that is, replace rows by columns and columns by rows, then the left row rank of the transposed matrix equals the left column rank of the original.
If then to the transposed matrix we apply the above considerations we arrive at $r \leq c$ and $r' \leq c'$.



\subsection{Non-homogeneous linear equations}

The system of non-homogeneous linear equations
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:Etw}
\begin{aligned}
a_{11}x_1 + a_{12}x_2 + \cdots + a_{1n}x_n &= b_1
\\
a_{21}x_1 + a_{22}x_2 + \cdots + a_{2n}x_n &= b_2
\\
\vdots &
\\
a_{m1}x_1 + a_{m2}x_2 + \cdots + a_{mn}x_n &= b_m
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}
has a solution if and only if the column vector
\[
\begin{pmatrix}
b_1 \\ \vdots \\ b_m
\end{pmatrix}
\]
lies in the space generated by the vectors
\[
\begin{pmatrix}
a_{11} \\ \vdots \\ a_{m1}
\end{pmatrix}
, \ldots, 
\begin{pmatrix}
a_{1n} \\ \vdots \\ a_{mn}
\end{pmatrix}.
\]
This means that there is a solution if and only if the right column rank of the matrix
\[
\begin{pmatrix}
a_{11} & \cdots & a_{1n}
\\
\vdots & \ddots & \vdots
\\
a_{m1} & \cdots & a_{mn}
\end{pmatrix}
\]
is the same as the right column rank of the augmented matrix
\[
\begin{pmatrix}
a_{11} & \cdots & a_{1n} & b_1
\\
\vdots & \ddots & \vdots & \vdots
\\
a_{m1} & \cdots & a_{mn} & b_m
\end{pmatrix}
\]
since the vector space generated by the original matrix must be the same as the vector space generated by the augmented matrix and in either case the dimension is the same as the rank of the matrix by Theorem~\ref{theo:tw}.

By Theorem~\ref{theo:fo}, this means that the row ranks are equal.
Conversely, if the row rank of the augmented matrix is the same as the row rank of the original matrix, the column ranks will be the same and the equations will have a solution.

If the equations~\eqref{eq:Etw} have a solution, then any relation among the rows of the original matrix subsists among the rows of the augmented matrix.
For equations~\eqref{eq:Etw} this merely means that like combinations of equals are equal.
Conversely, if each relation which subsists between the rows of the augmented matrix, then the row rank of the augmented matrix is the same as the row rank of the original matrix.
\emph{In terms of the equations this means that there will exist a solution if and only if the equations are consistent, i.e., if and only if any dependence betwee the left hand sides of the equations also holds between the right sides.}


\begin{theo}
\label{theo:fi}
If in equations~\eqref{eq:Etw} $m = n$, there exists a unique solution if and only if the corresponding homogeneous equations
\begin{align*}
a_{11}x_1 + a_{12}x_2 + \cdots + a_{1n}x_n &= 0
\\
\vdots &
\\
a_{n1}x_1 + a_{n2}x_2 + \cdots + a_{nn}x_n &= 0
\end{align*}
have only the trivial solution.
\end{theo}


If they have only the trivial solution, then the column vectors are independent.
It follows that the original $n$ equations in $n$ unknowns will have a unique solution if they have any solution, since the difference, term by term, of two distinct solutions would be a non-trivial solution of the homogeneous equations.
A solution would exist since the $n$ independent column vectors form a generating system for the $n$-dimensional space of column vectors.

Conversely, let us suppose our equations have one and only one solution.
In this case, the homogeneous equations added term by term to a solution of the original equations would yield a new solution to the original equations.
Hence, the homogeneous equations have only the trivial solution.


\subsection{Determinants}

The theory of determinants that we shall develop in this chapter is not need\-ed in Galois theory.
\marginpar{\tiny{Scribe: Then we'll defer typing it. It's long.}}
The reader may, therefore, omit this section if he so desires.%
\footnote{Of the preceding theory only Theorem~\ref{theo:on}, for homogeneous equations and the notion of linear dependence are assumed known.}




\section{Field theory}


\subsection{Extension fields}

If $E$ is a field and $F$ a subset of $E$ which, under the operations of addition and multiplication in $E$, itself forms a field, that is, if $F$ is a subfield of $E$, then we shall call $E$ an \emph{extension} of $F$.
The relation of being an extension of $F$ will be briefly designated by $F \subset E$.
If $\alpha, \beta, \gamma, \ldots$ are elements of $E$, then by $F(\alpha, \beta, \gamma, \ldots)$ we shall mean the set of elements in $E$ which can be expressed as quotients of polynomials in $\alpha, \beta, \gamma, \ldots$ with coefficients in $F$.
It is clear that $F(\alpha, \beta, \gamma, \ldots)$ is a field and is the smallest extension of $F$ which contains the elements $\alpha, \beta, \gamma, \ldots$.
We shall call $F(\alpha, \beta, \gamma, \ldots)$ the field obtained after the \emph{adjunction} of the elements $\alpha, \beta, \gamma, \ldots$ to $F$, or the field \emph{generated} out of $F$ by the elements $\alpha, \beta, \gamma, \ldots$.
In the sequel all fields will be assumed commutative.

If $F \subset E$, then ignoring the operation of multiplication defined between the elements of $E$, we may consider $E$ as a vector space over $F$.
By the \emph{degree} of $E$ over $F$, written $(E/F)$, we shall mean the dimension of the vector space $E$ over $F$.
If $(E/F)$ is finite, $E$ will be called a \emph{finite extension}.


\begin{theo}
\label{theo:si}
If $F, B, E$ are three fields such that $F \subset B \subset E$, then
\[
(E/F) = (B/F) \, (E/B).
\]
\end{theo}


Let $A_1, A_2, \ldots, A_r$ be elements of $E$ which are linearly independent with respect to $B$ and let $C_1, C_2, \ldots, C_s$ be elements of $B$ which are independent with respect to $F$.
Then the products $C_i A_j$ where $i = 1,2,\ldots, s$ and $j=1,2,\ldots,r$ are elements of $E$ which are independent with respect to $F$.
For if $\sum_{i,j} a_{ij} C_i A_j = 0$, then
$\sum_j (\sum_i a_{ij} C_i) A_j$ is a linear combination of the $A_j$ with coefficients in $B$ and because the $A_j$ were independent with respect to $B$ we have $\sum_i a_{ij} C_i = 0$ for each $j$.
The independence of $C_i$ with respect to $F$ then requires that each $a_{ij} = 0$.
Since there are $r \cdot s$ elements $C_i A_j$ we have shown that for each $r \leq (E/B)$ and $s \leq (B/F)$ the degree $(E/F) \geq r \cdot s$.
Therefore, $(E/F) \leq (B/F) (E/B)$.
If one of the latter numbers is infinite, the theorem follows.
If both $(E/B)$ and $(B/F)$ are finite, say $r$ and $s$ respectively, we may suppose that the $A_j$ and the $C_i$ are generating systems of $E$ an $B$ respectively, and we show that the set of products $C_i A_j$ is a generating system of $E$ over $F$.
Each $A \in E$ can be expressed linearly in terms of the $A_j$ with coefficients in $B$.
Thus, $A = \sum B_j A_j$
Moreover, each $B_j$ being an element of $B$ can be expressed linearly with coefficients in $F$ in terms of the $C_i$, i.e., $B_j = \sum a_{ij} C_i$, $j=1,2,\ldots,r$.
Thus, $A = \sum a_{ij} C_i A_j$ and the $C_iA_j$ for an independent generating systme of $E$ over $F$.


\begin{coro*}
\label{coro:p22}
If $F \subset F_1 \subset F_2 \subset \cdots \subset F_n$, then 
\[
(F_n/F) = (F_1/F) \cdot (F_2/F_1) \, \cdots \, (F_n/F_{n-1}).
\]
\end{coro*}


\subsection{Polynomials}

An expression of the form $a_0 x^n + a_1 x^{n-1} + \cdots + a_n$ is called a \emph{polynomial} in $F$ of degree $n$ if the coefficients $a_0, \ldots, a_n$ are elements of the field $F$ and $a_0 \not= 0$.
Multiplication and addition of polynomials are performed in the usual way.%
\footnote{If we speak of the set of all polynomials of degree lower than $n$, we shall agree to include the polynomial $0$ in this set, though it has no degree in the proper sense.}

A polynomial in $F$ is called \emph{reducible} in $F$ if it is equal to the product of two polynomials in $F$ each of degree at least one.
Polynomials which are not reducible in $F$ are called \emph{irreducible} in $F$.

If $f(x) = g(x) \cdot h(x)$ is a relation which holds between polynomials $f(x)$, $g(x)$, $h(x)$ in a field $F$, then we shall say that $g(x)$ \emph{divides} $f(x)$ in $F$, or that $g(x)$ is a \emph{factor} of $f(x)$.
It is readily seen that the degree of $f(x)$ is equal to the sum of the degrees of $g(x)$ and $h(x)$, so that if neither $g(x)$ nor $h(x)$ is a constant then each has a degree less than $f(x)$.
It follows from this that by a finite number of factorizations a polynomial can always be expressed as a product of irreducible polynomials in a field $F$.

For any two polynomials $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ the division algorithm holds, i.e., $f(x) = q(x) g(x) + r(x)$ where $q(x)$ and $r(x)$ are unique polynomials in $F$ and the degree of $r(x)$ is less than that of $g(x)$.
This may be shown by the argument as the reader met in elementary algebra in the case of the field of real or complex numbers.
We also see that $r(x)$ is the uniquely determined polynomial of a degree less than that of $g(x)$ such that $f(x) - r(x)$ is divisible by $g(x)$.
We shall call $r(x)$ the \emph{remainder} of $f(x)$.

Also, in the usual way, it may be shown that if $\alpha$ is a root of the polynomial $f(x)$ in $F$ then $x - \alpha$ is a factor of $f(x)$, and as a consequence of this that a polynomial in a field cannot have more roots in the field than its degree.


\begin{lemm}
\label{lemm:p24}
If $f(x)$ is an irreducible polynomial of degree $n$ in $F$, then there do not exist two polynomials each of degree less than $n$ in $F$ whose product is divisible by $f(x)$.
\end{lemm}

Let us suppose to the contrary that $g(x)$ and $h(x)$ are polynomials of degree less than $n$ whose product is divisible by $f(x)$.
Among all polynomials occurring in such pairs we may suppose $g(x)$ has the smallest degree.
Then since $f(x)$ is a factor of $g(x) \cdot h(x)$ there is a polynomial $k(x)$ such that
\[
k(x) \cdot f(x) = g(x) \cdot h(x).
\]
By the division algorithm,
\[
f(x) = q(x) \cdot g(x) + r(x)
\]
where the degree of $r(x)$ is less than that of $g(x)$ and $r(x) \not= 0$ since $f(x)$ was assumed to be irreducible.
Multiplying
\[
f(x) = q(x) \cdot g(x) + r(x)
\]
by $h(x)$ and transposing, we have
\[
r(x) \cdot h(x)
= f(x) \cdot h(x) - q(x) \cdot g(x) \cdot h(x)
= f(x) \cdot h(x) - q(x) \cdot k(x) \cdot f(x)
\]
from which it follows that $r(x) \cdot h(x)$ is divisible by $f(x)$.
Since $r(x)$ has a smaller degree than $g(x)$, this last is in contradiction to the choice of $g(x)$, from which the lemma follows.

As we saw, many of the theorems of elementary algebra hold in any field~$F$.
However, the so-called Fundamental Theorem of Algebra, at least in its customary form, does not hold.
It will be replaced by a theorem due to Kronecker which guarantees for a given polynomial in $F$ the existence of an extension field in which the polynomial has a root.
We shall also show that, in a given field, a polynomial can not only be factored into irreducible factors, but that this factorization is unique up to a constant factor.
The uniqueness depends on the theorem of Kronecker.


\subsection{Algebraic elements}

Let $F$ be a field and $E$ an extension field of $F$.
If $\alpha$ is an element of $E$ we may ask whether there are polynomials with coefficients in $F$ which have $\alpha$ as a root.
$\alpha$ is called \emph{algebraic} with respect to $F$ if there are such polynomials.
Now let $\alpha$ be algebraic and select among all polynomials in $F$ which have $\alpha$ as root one, $f(x)$, of lowest degree.

We may assume that the highest coefficient of $f(x)$ is $1$.
We content that this $f(x)$ is uniquely determined, that it is irreducible and that each polynomial in $F$ with the root $\alpha$ is divisible by $f(x)$.
If, indeed, $g(x)$ is a polynomial in $F$ with $g(\alpha) = 0$, we may divide $g(x) = f(x) q(x) + r(x)$ where $r(x)$ has a degree smaller than that of $f(x)$.
\label{p25}%
Substituting $x = \alpha$ we get $r(\alpha) = 0$.
Now $r(x)$ has to be identically $0$ since otherwise $r(x)$ would have the root $\alpha$ and be of degree lower than $f(x)$.
So $g(x)$ is divisible by $f(x)$.
This also shows the uniqueness of $f(x)$.
If $f(x)$ were not irreducible, one of the factors would have to vanish for $x = \alpha$ contradicting again the choice of $f(x)$.

We now consider the subset $E_0$ of the following elements $\theta$ of $E$:
\[
\theta = g(\alpha) = c_0 + c_1\alpha + c_2\alpha^2 + \cdots + c_{n-1} \alpha^{n-1}
\]
where $g(x)$ is a polynomial in $F$ of degree less than $n$ ($n$ being the degree of $f(x)$).
This set $E_0$ is closed under addition and multiplication.
The latter may be verified as follows:

If $g(x)$ and $h(x)$ are two polynomials of degree less than $n$ we put 
\[
g(x) h(x) = q(x) f(x) + r(x)
\]
and hence $g(\alpha) h(\alpha) = r(\alpha)$.
Finally we see that the constants $c_0, c_1, \ldots, c_{n-1}$ are uniquely determined by the element $\theta$.
Indeed two expressions for the same $\theta$ would lead after subtracting to an equation for $\alpha$ of lower degree than $n$.

We remark that the internal structure of the set $E_0$ does not depend on the nature of $\alpha$ but only on the irreducible $f(x)$.
The knowledge of this polynomial enables us to perform the operations of addition and multiplication in our set $E_0$.
We shall see very soon that $E_0$ is a field; in fact, $E_0$ is nothing but the field $F(\alpha)$.
As soon as this is shown we have at once the degree, $(F(\alpha)/F)$, determined as $n$, since the space $F(\alpha)$ is generated by the linearly independent $1, \alpha, \alpha^2, \ldots, \alpha^{n-1}$.

We shall now try to imitate the set $E_0$ without having an extension field $E$ and an element $\alpha$ at our disposal.
We shall assume only an irreducible polynomial
\[
f(x) = x^n + a_{n-1} x^{n-1} + \cdots + a_0
\]
as given.

We select a symbol $\xi$ and let $E_1$ be the set of all formal polynomials
\[
g(\xi) = c_0 + c_1 \xi + \cdots + c_{n-1} \xi^{n-1}
\]
of a degree lower than $n$.
This set forms a group under addition.
We now introduce besides the ordinary multiplication a new kind of multiplication of two elements $g(\xi)$ and $h(\xi)$ of $E_1$ denoted by $g(\xi) \times h(\xi)$.
It is defined as the remainder $r(\xi)$ of the ordinary product $g(\xi) h(\xi)$ under division by $f(\xi)$.
We first remark that any product of $m$ terms $g_1(\xi), g_2(\xi), \ldots, g_m(\xi)$ is again the remainder of the ordinary product $g_1(\xi) g_2(\xi) \cdots g_m(\xi)$.
This is true by definition for $m = 2$ and follows for every $m$ by induction if we just prove the easy lemma: The remainder of the product of two remainders (of two polynomials) is the remainder of the product of these two polynomials.
This fact shows that our new product is associative and commutative and also that the new product $g_1(\xi) \times g_2(\xi) \times \cdots \times g_m(\xi)$ will coincide with the old product $g_1(\xi) g_2(\xi) \cdots g_m(\xi)$ if the latter does not exceed $n$ in degree.
The distributive law for our multiplication is readily verified.

The set $E_1$ contains our field $F$ and our multiplication in $E_1$ has for $F$ the meaning of the old multiplication.
One of the polynomials of $E_1$ is $\xi$.
Multiplying it $i$-times with itself, clearly will just lead to $\xi^i$ as long as $i < n$.
For $i = n$ this is not any more the case since it leads to the remainder of the polynomial $\xi^n$.
This remainder is
\[
\xi^n - f(\xi)
= -a_{n-1} \xi^{n-1} - a_{n-2} \xi^{n-2} - \cdots - a_0.
\]

We now give up our old multiplication altogether and keep only the new one;
we also change notation, using the point (or juxtaposition) as symbol for the new multiplication.

Computing in this sense
\[
c_0 + c_1 \xi + c_2 \xi^2 + \cdots + c_{n-1} \xi^{n-1}
\]
will readily lead to this element, since all the degrees involved are below $n$.
But
\[
\xi^n
= -a_{n-1} \xi^{n-1} - a_{n-2} \xi^{n-2} - \cdots - a_0.
\]
Transposing we see that $f(\xi) = 0$.

We have thus constructed a set $E_1$ and an addition and multiplication in $E_1$ that already satisfies most of the field axioms.
$E_1$ contains $F$ as a subfield an $\xi$ satisfies the equation $f(\xi) = 0$.
We next have to show:
If $g(\xi) \not= 0$ and $h(\xi)$ are given elements of $E_1$, there is an element
\[
X(\xi) = x_0 + x_1 \xi + \cdots + x_{n-1} \xi^{n-1}
\]
in $E_1$ such that
\[
g(\xi) \cdot X(\xi) = h(\xi).
\]
To prove it we consider the coefficients $x_i$ of $X(\xi)$ as unknowns and compute nevertheless the product on the left side, always reducing higher powers of $\xi$ to lower ones.
The result is an expression $L_0 + L_1 \xi + \cdots + L_{n-1} \xi^{n-1}$ where each $L_i$ is a linear combination of the $x_i$ with coefficients in $F$.
This expression is to be equal to $h(\xi)$; this leads to the $n$ equations with $n$ unknowns:
\[
L_0 = b_0,
\quad
L_1 = b_1,
\quad
\ldots, \quad
L_{n-1} = b_{n-1}
\]
where the $b_i$ are the coefficients of $h(\xi)$.
This system will be soluble if the corresponding homogeneous equations
\[
L_0 = 0,
\quad
L_1 = 0,
\quad
\ldots, \quad
L_{n-1} = 0
\]
have only the trivial solution.

The homogeneous problem would occur if we should ask for the set of elements $X(\xi)$ satisfying $g(\xi) \cdot X(\xi) = 0$.
Going back for a moment to the old multiplication this would mean that the ordinary product $g(x) X(\xi)$ has the remainder $0$, and is therefore divisible by $f(\xi)$.
According to the lemma, page~\pageref{lemm:p24}, this is only possible for $X(\xi) = 0$.

Therefore $E_1$ is a field.

Assume now that we also have our old extension $E$ with a root $\alpha$ of $f(x)$, leading to the set $E_0$.
We see that $E_0$ has in a certain sense the same structure as $E_1$ if we map the element $g(\xi)$ of $E_1$ onto the element $g(\alpha)$ of $E_0$.
This mapping will have the property that the image of a sum of elements is the sum of the images, and the image of a product is the product of the images.

Let us therefore define:
A mapping $\sigma$ of one field onto another which is one to one in both directions such that $\sigma(\alpha + \beta) = \sigma(\alpha) + \sigma(\beta)$ and $\sigma(\alpha \cdot \beta) = \sigma(\alpha) \cdot \sigma(\beta)$ is called an \emph{isomorphism}.
If the fields in question are not distinct -- i.e., are both the same field -- the isomorphism is called an \emph{automorphism}.
Two fields for which there exists an isomorphism mapping one on another are called \emph{isomorphic}.
If not every element of the image field is the image under $\sigma$ of an element in the first field, then $\sigma$ is called an isomorphism of the first field \emph{into} the second.
Under each isomorphism it is clear that $\sigma(0) = 0$ and $\sigma(1) = 1$.

We see that $E_0$ is also a field and that it is isomorphic to $E_1$.

We now mention a few theroems that follow from our discussion:

\begin{theo}[Kronecker]
\label{theo:se}
If $f(x)$ is a polynomial in a field $F$, there exists an extension $E$ of $F$ in which $f(x)$ has a root.
\end{theo}

\begin{proof}
Construct an extension field in which an irreducible factor of $f(x)$ has a root.
\end{proof}

\begin{theo}
\label{theo:ei}
Let $\sigma$ be an isomorphism mapping a field $F$ on a field $F'$.
Let $f(x)$ be an irreducible polynomial in $F$ and $f'(x)$ the corresponding polynomial in $F'$.
If $E = F(\beta)$ and $E' = F'(\beta')$ are extensions of $F$ and $F'$, respectively, where $f(\beta) = 0$ in $E$ and $f'(\beta') = 0$ in $E'$, then $\sigma$ can be extended to an isomorphicm between $E$ and $E'$.
\end{theo}

\begin{proof}
$E$ and $E'$ are both isomorphic to $E_0$.
\end{proof}


\subsection{Splitting fields}

If $F$, $B$ and $E$ are three fields such that $F \subset B \subset E$, then we shall refer to $B$ as an \emph{intermediate field}.

If $E$ is an extension of a field $F$ in which a polynomial $p(x)$ in $F$ can be factored into linear factors, and if $p(x)$ can not so be factored in any intermediate field, then we call $E$ a \emph{splitting} field for $p(x)$.
Thus, if $E$ is a splitting field of $p(x)$, \emph{the roots of $p(x)$ generate $E$}.

A splitting field is of finite degree since it is constructed by a finite number of adjunctions of algebraic elements, each defining an extension field of finite degree.
Because of the corollary on page~\pageref{coro:p22}, the total degree is finite.

\begin{theo}
\label{theo:ni}
If $p(x)$ is a polynomial in a field $F$, there exists a splitting field $E$ of $p(x)$.
\end{theo}

We factor $p(x)$ in $F$ into irreducible factors $f_1(x) \cdots f_r(x) = p(x)$.
If each of these is of the first degree then $F$ itself is the required splitting field.
Suppose then that $f_1(x)$ is of degree higher than the first.
By Theorem~\ref{theo:se} there is an extension $F_1$ of $F$ in which $f_1(x)$ has a root.
Factor each of the factors $f_1(x), \ldots, f_r(x)$ into irreducible factors in $F_1$ and proceed as before.
We finally arrive at a field in which $p(x)$ can be split into linear factors.
The field generated out of $F$ by the roots of $p(x)$ is the required splitting field.

The following theorem asserts that up to isomorphisms, the splitting field of a polynomial is unique.

\begin{theo}
\label{theo:onze}
Let $\sigma$ be an isomorphism mapping the field $F$ on the field $F'$.
Let $p(x)$ be a polynomial in $F$ and $p'(x)$ the polynomial in $F'$ with coefficients corresponding to those of $p(x)$ under $\sigma$.
Finally, let $E$ be a splitting field of $p(x)$ and $E'$ a splitting field of $p'(x)$.
Under these conditions the isomorphism $\sigma$ can be extended to an isomorphism between $E$ and $E'$.
\end{theo}

If $f(x)$ is an irreducible factor of $p(x)$ in $F$, then $E$ contains a root of $f(x)$.
For let $p(x) = (x - \alpha_1) (x - \alpha_2) \cdots (x - \alpha_s)$ be the splitting of $p(x)$ in $E$.
Then $(x - \alpha_1) (x - \alpha_2) \cdots (x - \alpha_s) = f(x) g(x)$.
We consider $(x)$ as a polynomial in $E$ and construct the extension field $B = E(\alpha)$ in which $f(\alpha) = 0$.
Then $(\alpha - \alpha_1) \cdot (\alpha - \alpha_2) \cdot \cdots \cdot (\alpha - \alpha_s) = f(\alpha) \cdot g(\alpha) = 0$ and $\alpha - \alpha_i$ being elements of the field $B$ can have a product equal to $0$ only if for one of the factors, say the first, we have $\alpha - \alpha_1 = 0$.
Thus, $\alpha = \alpha_1$, and $\alpha_1$ is a root of $f(x)$.

Now in case all roots of $p(x)$ are in $F$, then $E = F$ and $p(x)$ can be split in $F$.
This factored form has an image in $F'$ which is a splitting of $p'(x)$, since the isomorphism $\sigma$ preserves all operations of addition and multiplication in the process of multiplying out the factors of $p(x)$ and collecting to get the original form.
Since $p'(x)$ can be split in $F'$, we must have $F' = E'$.
In this case, $\sigma$ itself is the required extension and the theorem is proved if all roots of $p(x)$ are in $F$.

We proceed by complete induction.
Let us suppose the theorem proved for all cases in which the number of roots of $p(x)$ outside of $F$ is less than $n > 1$, and suppose that $p(x)$ is a polynomial having $n$ roots outside of $F$.
We factor $p(x)$ into irreducible factors in $F$; $p(x) = f_1(x) f_2(x) \cdots f_m(x)$.
Not all of these factors can be of degree 1, since otherwise $p(x)$ would split in $F$, contrary to assumption.
Hence, we may suppose the degree of $f_1(x)$ to be $r > 1$.
Let $f'_1(x) f'_2(x) \cdots f'_m(x) = p'(x)$ be the factorization of $p'(x)$ into the polynomials corresponding to $f_1(x), \ldots, f_m(x)$ under $\sigma$.
$f'_1(x)$ is irreducible in $F'$, for a factorization of $f'_1(x)$ in $F'$ would induce\footnote{See page~\pageref{p38} for the definition of $\sigma^{-1}$.} under $\sigma^{-1}$ a factorization of $f_1(x)$, which was however taken to be irreducible.

By Theorem~\ref{theo:ei}, the isomorphism $\sigma$ can be extended to an isomorphism $\sigma_1$, between the fields $F(\alpha)$ and $F'(\alpha')$.

Since $F \subset F(\alpha)$, $p(x)$ is a polynomial in $F(\alpha)$ and $E$ is a splitting field for $p(x)$ in $F(\alpha)$.
Similarly for $p'(x)$.
There are now less than $n$ roots of $p(x)$ outside the new ground field $F(\alpha)$.
Hence by our inductive assumption $\sigma_1$ can be extended from an isomorphism between $F(\alpha)$ and $F'(\alpha')$ to an isomorphism $\sigma_2$ between $E$ and $E'$.
Since $\sigma_1$ is an extension of $\sigma$, and $\sigma_2$ and extension of $\sigma_1$, we conclude $\sigma_2$ is an extension of $\sigma$ and the theorem follows.


\begin{coro*}
If $p(x)$ is a polynomial in a field $F$, then any two splitting fields for $p(x)$ are isomorphic.
\end{coro*}

This follows from Theorem~\ref{theo:onze} if we take $F = F'$ and $\sigma$ to be the identity mapping, i.e., $\sigma(x) = x$.

As a consequence of this corollary we see that we are justified in using the expression ``the splitting field of $p(x)$'' since any two differ only by an isomorphism.
Thus, if $p(x)$ has repeated roots in one splitting field, so also in any other splitting field it will have repeated roots.
The statement ``$p(x)$ has repeated roots'' will be significant without reference to a particular splitting field.



\subsection{Unique decomposition of polynomials into irreducible factors}


\begin{theo}
\label{theo:onon}
If $p(x)$ is a polynomial in a field $F$, and if $p(x) = p_1(x) \cdot p_2(x) \cdot \cdots \cdot p_r(x) = q_1(x) \cdot q_2(x) \cdot \cdots \cdot q_s(x)$ are two factorizations of $p(x)$ into irreducible polynomials each of degree at least one, then $r = s$ and after a suitable change in the order in which the $q$'s are written, $p_i(x) = c_i q_i(x)$, $i = 1,2,\ldots,r$ and $c_i \in F$.
\end{theo}

Let $F(\alpha)$ be an extension of $F$ in which $p_1(\alpha) = 0$.
We may suppose the leading coefficients of the $p_i(x)$ and the $q_i(x)$ to be 1, for, by factoring out all leading coefficients and combining, the constant multiplier on each side of the equation must be the leading coefficient of $p(x)$ and hence can be divided out of both sides of the equation.
Since $0 = p_1(\alpha) \cdot p_2(\alpha) \cdot \cdots \cdot p_r(\alpha) = p(\alpha) = q_1(\alpha) \cdot \cdots \cdot q_s(\alpha)$ and since a product of elements of $F(\alpha)$ can be 0 only lif one of these is 0, it follows that one ofthe $q_i(\alpha)$, say $q_1(\alpha)$ is 0.
This gives (see page~\pageref{p25}) $p_1(x) = q_1(x)$.
Thus $p_1(x) \cdot p_2(x) \cdot \cdots \cdot p_r(x) = p_1(x) \cdot q_2(x) \cdot \cdots \cdot q_s(x)$ or $p_1(x) \cdot (p_2(x) \cdot \cdots \cdot p_r(x) - q_2(x) \cdot \cdots \cdot q_s(x)) = 0$.
Since the product of two polynomials is $0$ only if one of the two is the $0$ polynomial, it follows that the polynomial within the brackets is 0 so that $p_2(x) \cdot \cdots \cdot p_r(x) = q_2(x) \cdot \cdots \cdot q_s(x)$.
If we repeat the above argument $r$ times we obtain $p_i(x) = q_i(x)$, $i = 1,2,\ldots, r$.
Since the remaining $q$'s must have a product 1, it follows that $r = s$.


\subsection{Group characters}

If $G$ is a multiplicative group, $F$ a field and $\sigma$ a homomorphism mapping $G$ into $F$, then $\sigma$ is called a \emph{character} of $G$ in $F$.
By homomorphism is meant a mapping $\sigma$ such that for $\alpha, \beta$ any two elements of $G$, $\sigma(\alpha) \cdot \sigma(\beta) = \sigma(\alpha \cdot \beta)$ and $\sigma(\alpha) \not= 0$ for any $\alpha$.
(If $\sigma(\alpha) = 0$ for one element $\alpha$, then $\sigma(x) = 0$ for each $x \in G$, since $\sigma(\alpha y) = \sigma(\alpha) \sigma(y) = 0$ and $\alpha y$ takes all values in $G$ when $y$ assumes all values in $G$.)

The characters $\sigma_1, \sigma_2, \ldots, \sigma_n$ are called \emph{dependent} if there exist elements $a_1, a_2, \ldots a_n$ not all zero in $F$ such that $a_1 \sigma_1(x) + a_2 \sigma_2(x) + \cdots + a_n \sigma_n(x) = 0$ for each $x \in G$.
Such a dependence relation is called \emph{non-trivial}.
If the characters are not dependent they are called \emph{independent}.


\begin{theo}
\label{theo:ontw}
If $G$ is a group and $\sigma_1, \sigma_2, \ldots, \sigma_n$ are $n$ mutually distinct characters of $G$ in a field $F$, the $\sigma_1, \sigma_2, \ldots, \sigma_n$ are independent.
\end{theo}


One character cannot be dependent, since $a_1 \sigma_1(x) = 0$ implies $a_1 = 0$ due to the assumption that $\sigma_1(x) \not= 0$.
Suppose $n > 1$.
We make the inductive assumption that no set of less than $n$ distinct characters is dependent.
Suppose now that $a_1 \sigma_1(x) + a_2 \sigma_2(x) + \cdots + a_n \sigma_n(x) = 0$ is a non-trivial dependence between the $\sigma$'s.
None of the elements $a_i$ is zero, else we should have a dependence between less than $n$ characters contrary to our inductive assumption.
Since $\sigma_1$ and $\sigma_n$ are distinct, there exists an element $\alpha$ in $G$ such that $\sigma_1(\alpha) \not= \sigma_n(\alpha)$.
Multiply the relation between the $\sigma$'s by $a_n^{-1}$.
We obtain a relation
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:star}
b_1 \sigma_1(x) + \cdots + b_{n-1} \sigma_{n-1}(x) + \sigma_n(x) = 0,
\quad
b_i = a_n^{-1} a_i \not= 0.
\tag{$*$}
\end{equation}
Replace in this relation $x$ by $\alpha x$. We have
\[
b_1 \sigma_1(\alpha) \sigma_1(x) 
+ \cdots 
+ b_{n-1} \sigma_{n-1} (\alpha) \sigma_{n-1}(x) 
+ \sigma_n(\alpha) \sigma_n(x) = 0,
\]
or $\sigma_n^{-1} b_1 \sigma_1(\alpha) \sigma_1(x) + \cdots + \sigma_n(x) = 0$.
Subtracting the latter from \eqref{eq:star} we have
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:starstar}
\bigl(b_1 - \sigma_n(\alpha)^{-1}b_1 \sigma_1(\alpha)\bigr) \sigma_1(x)
+ \cdots
+ c_{n-1} \sigma_{n-1}() = 0.
\tag{$**$}
\end{equation}
The coefficient of $\sigma_1(x)$ in this relation is not 0, otherwise we should have $b_1 = \sigma_n(\alpha)^{-1}b_1\sigma_1(\alpha)$, so that
\[
\sigma_n(\alpha) b_1 = b_1 \sigma_1(\alpha) = \sigma_1(\alpha)b_1
\]
and since $b_1 \not= 0$, we get $\sigma_n(\alpha) = \sigma_1(\alpha)$ contrary to the choice of $\alpha$.
Thus, \eqref{eq:starstar} is a non-trivial dependence between $\sigma_1, \sigma_2, \ldots, \sigma_{n-1}$ which is contrary to our inductive assumption.


\begin{coro*}
If $E$ and $E'$ are two fields, and $\sigma_1, \sigma_2, \ldots, \sigma_n$ are $n$ mutually distinct isomorphisms mapping $E$ into $E'$, then $\sigma_1, \ldots, \sigma_n$ are independent.
(Where ``independent'' again means that there exists no non-trivial dependence $a_1 \sigma_1(x) + \cdots + a_n \sigma_n(x) = 0$ which holds for every $x \in E$.)
\end{coro*}


This follows from Theorem~\ref{theo:ontw}, since $E$ without the 0 is a group and the $\sigma$'s defined in this group are mutually distinct characters.

If $\sigma_1, \sigma_2, \ldots, \sigma_n$ are isomorphisms of a field $E$ into a field $E'$, then each element $a$ of $E$ such that $\sigma_1(a) = \sigma_2(a) = \ldots = \sigma_n(a)$ is called a \emph{fixed point} of $E$ under $\sigma_1, \sigma_2, \ldots, \sigma_n$.
This name is chosen because in the case where the $\sigma$'s are automorphisms and $\sigma_1$ is the identity, i.e., $\sigma_1(x) = x$, we have $\sigma_i(x) = x$ for a fixed point.


\begin{lemm}
The set of fixed points of $E$ is a subfield of $E$.
We shall call this subfield the fixed field.
\end{lemm}

For if $a$ and $b$ are fixed points, then $\sigma_i(a + b) = \sigma_i(a) + \sigma_i(b) = \sigma_j(a) + \sigma_j(b) = \sigma_j(a + b)$ and $\sigma_i(a \cdot b) = \sigma_i(a) \cdot \sigma_i(b) = \sigma_j(a) \cdot \sigma_j(b) = \sigma_j(a \cdot b)$.
Finally from $\sigma_i(a) = \sigma_j(a)$ we have $(\sigma_j(a))^{-1} = (\sigma_i(a))^{-1} = \sigma_i(a^{-1}) = \sigma_j(a^{-1})$.
Thus, the sum and products of two fixed points is a fixed point, and the inverse of a fixed point is a fixed point.
Clearly, the negative of a fixed point is a fixed point.


\begin{theo}
\label{theo:onth}
If $\sigma_1, \ldots, \sigma_n$ are $n$ mutually distinct isomorphisms of a field $E$ into a field $E'$, and if $F$ is the fixed field of $E$, then $(E/F) \geq n$.
\end{theo}

Suppose to the contrary that $(E/F) = r < n$.
We shall show that we are led to a contradiction.
Let $\omega_1, \omega_2, \ldots, \omega_r$ be a generating system of $E$ of $F$.
In the homogeneous linear equations
\begin{align*}
\sigma_1(\omega_1)x_1 + \sigma_2(\omega_1)x_2 + \cdots + \sigma_n(\omega_1)x_n &= 0
\\
\sigma_1(\omega_2)x_1 + \sigma_2(\omega_2)x_2 + \cdots + \sigma_n(\omega_2)x_n &= 0
\\
\vdots &
\\
\sigma_1(\omega_r)x_1 + \sigma_2(\omega_r)x_2 + \cdots + \sigma_n(\omega_r)x_n &= 0
\end{align*}
there are more unknowns than equations so that there exists a non-trivial solution which, we may suppose, $x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n$ denotes.
For any element $\alpha$ in $E$ we can find $a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_r$ in $F$ such that $\alpha = a_1 \omega_1 + \cdots + a_r \omega_r$.
We multiply the first equation by $\sigma_1(a)$, the second by $\sigma_1(a_2)$, and so on.
Using that $a_i \in F$, hence that $\sigma_1(a_i) = \sigma_j(a_i)$ and also that $\sigma_j(a_i) \sigma_j(\omega_i) = \sigma_j(a_i \omega_i)$, we obtain
\begin{align*}
\sigma_1(a_1 \omega_1)x_1 + \cdots + \sigma_n(a_1 \omega_1)x_n &= 0
\\
\vdots &
\\
\sigma_1(a_r \omega_r)x_1 + \cdots + \sigma_n(a_r \omega_r)x_n &= 0.
\end{align*}
Adding these last equations and using
\[
\sigma_i(a_1 \omega_1) + \sigma_i(a_2 \omega_2) + \cdots + \sigma_i(a_r \omega_r)
= \sigma_i(a_1 \omega_1 + \cdots + a_r \omega_r) 
= \sigma_i(\alpha)
\]
we obtain
\[
\sigma_1(\alpha)x_1 + \sigma_2(\alpha)x_2 + \cdots + \sigma_n(\alpha)x_n = 0.
\]
This, however, is a non-trivial dependence relation between $\sigma_1, \sigma_2, \ldots, \sigma_n$ which cannot exist according to the corollary of Theroem~\ref{theo:ontw}. 


\begin{coro*}
If $\sigma_1, \sigma_2, \ldots, \sigma_n$ are automorphisms of the field $E$, and $F$ is the fixed field, then $(E/F) \geq n$.
\end{coro*}


If $F$ is a subfield of the field $E$, and $\sigma$ an automorphism of $E$, we shall say that $\sigma$ \emph{leaves $F$ fixed} if for each element $a$ of $F$, $\sigma(a) = a$.
If $\sigma$ and $\tau$ are two automorphisms of $E$, then the mapping $\sigma(\tau(x))$ written briefly $\sigma\tau$ is an automorphism, as the reader may readily verify.
(E.G., $\sigma\tau(x\cdot y) = \sigma(\tau(x \cdot y)) = \sigma(\tau(x) \cdot \tau(y)) = \sigma(\tau(x)) \cdot \sigma(\tau(y))$.)
We shall call $\sigma\tau$ the \emph{product} of $\sigma$ and $\tau$.
If $\sigma$ is an automorphism ($\sigma(x) = y$), then we shall call $\sigma^{-1}$ the mapping of $y$ into $x$, i.e., $\sigma^{-1}(y) = x$ the inverse of $\sigma$.\label{p38}
The reader may readily verify that $\sigma^{-1}$ is an automorphism.
The automorphism $I(x) = x$ shall be called the \emph{unit automorphism}.


\begin{lemm}
If $E$ is an extension field of $F$, the set $G$ of automorphisms which leave $F$ fixed is a group.
\end{lemm}


The product of two automorphisms which leave $F$ fixed clearly leaves $F$ fixed.
Also, the inverse of any automorphism in $G$ is in $G$.

The reader will observe that $G$, the set of automorphisms which leave $F$ fixed, does not necessarily have $F$ as its fixed field.
It may be that certain elements in $E$ which do not belong to $F$ are left fixed by every automorphism which leaves $F$ fixed.
Thus, the fixed field of $G$ may be larger than $F$.


\subsection{Applications and examples to Theorem~\ref{theo:onth}}


Theorem \ref{theo:onth} is very powerful as the following examples show:


1)
Let $k$ be a field and consider the field $E = k(x)$ of all rational functions of the variable $x$.
If we map each of the functions $f(x)$ of $E$ onto $f(1/x)$ we obviously obtain an automorphism of $E$.
Let us consider the following six automorphisms where $f(x)$ is mapped onto $f(x)$ (identity), $f(1-x)$, $f(1/x)$, $f(1-1/x)$, $f(1/(1-x))$ and $f(x/(x-1))$ and call $F$ the fixed point field.
$F$ consists of all rational functions satisfying
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:twGon}
f(x)
= f(1-x)
= f\Bigl(\frac 1x\Bigr)
= f\Bigl(1 - \frac 1x\Bigr)
= f\Bigl(\frac 1{1-x}\Bigr)
= f\Bigl(\frac{x}{x-1}\Bigr).
\end{equation}
It suffices to check the first two equalities, the others being consequences.
The function
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:twGtw}
I = I(x) = \frac{(x^2 - x + 1)^3}{x^2(x-1)^2}
\end{equation}
belongs to $F$ as is readily seen.
Hence, the field $S = k(I)$ of all rational functions of $I$ will belong to $F$.

We contend: $F = S$ and $(E/F) = 6$.

Indeed, from Theorem~\ref{theo:onth} we obtain $(E/F) \geq 6$.
Since $S \subset F$ it suffices to prove $(E/S) \leq 6$.
Now $E = S(x)$.
It is thus sufficient to find some 6-th degree equation with coefficients in $S$ satisfied by $x$.
The following one is obviously satisfied;
\[
        (x^2 - x + 1)^3 - 1 \cdot x^2(x-1)^2 = 0.
\]

The reader will find the study of these fields a profitable exercise.
At a later occasion he will be able to derive all intermediate fields.


2)
Let $k$ be a field and $E = k(x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n)$ the field of all rational functions of $n$ variables $x_1,x_2, \ldots, x_n$.
If $(\nu_1, \nu_2, \ldots, \nu_n)$ is a permutation of $(1,2,\ldots,n)$ we replace in each function $f(x_1,x_2,\ldots,x_n)$ of $E$ the variable $x_1$ by $x_{\nu_1}$, $x_2$ by $x_{\nu_2}$, \ldots, $x_n$ by $x_{\nu_n}$.
The mapping of $E$ onto itself obtained in this way is obviously an automorphism and we may construct $n!$ automorphisms in this fashion (including the identity).
Let $F$ be the fixed point field, that is, the set of all so-called ``symmetric functions''.
Theorem~\ref{theo:onth} shows that $(E/F) \geq n!$.
Let us introduce the polynomial:
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:twGth}
f(t) = (t-x_1)(t-x_2) \cdots (t-x_n)
= t^n + a_1 t^{n-1} + \cdots + a_n
\end{equation}
where $a_1 = -(x_1 + x_2 + \cdots + x_n)$; $a_2 = +(x_1x_2 + x_1x_3 + \cdots + x_{n-1}x_n)$, and more generally $a_i$ is $(-1)^i$ times the sum of all products of $i$ different variables of the set $x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n$.
The functions $a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$ are called the elementary symmetric functions and the field $S = k(a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n)$ of all rational functions of $a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$ is obviously a part of $F$.
Should we succeed in proving $(E/S) \leq n!$ we would have shown $S = F$ and $(E/F) = n!$.

We construct to this effect the following tower of fields:
\[
S = S_n
\subset S_{n-1}
\subset S_{n-2}
\subset \cdots
\subset S_2
\subset S_1 = E
\]
by the definition
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:twGfo}
S_n = S;
\quad
S_i = S(x_{i+1}, x_{i+2}, \ldots, x_n) = S_{i+1}(x_{i+1}).
\end{equation}
It would be sufficient to prove $(S_{i-1} / S_i) \leq i$ or that the generator $x_i$ for $S_{i-1}$ out of $S_i$ satisfies an equation of degree $i$ with coefficients in $S_i$.

Such an equation is easily constructed.
Put
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:twGfi}
F_i(t)
= \frac{f(t)}{(t-x_{i+1})(t-x_{i+2}) \cdots (t-x_{i+n})}
= \frac{F_{i+1}(t)}{(t-x_{i+1})}
\end{equation}
and $F_n(t) = f(t)$.
Performing the division we see that $F_i(t)$ is a polynomial in $t$ of degree $i$ whose highest coefficient is $1$ and whose coefficients are polynomials in the variables $a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$ and $x_{i+1}, x_{i+2}, \ldots, x_n$.
Only integers enter as coefficients in these expressions.
Now $x_i$ is obviously a root of $F_i(t) = 0$.

Now let $g(x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n)$ be a \emph{polynomial} in $x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n$.
Since $F_1(x_1) = 0$ is of first degree in $x_1$, we can express $x_1$ as a polynomial of the $a_i$ and of $x_2, x_3, \ldots, x_n$.
We introduce this expression in $g(x_1,x_2,\ldots,x_n)$.
Since $F_2(x_2) = 0$ we can express $x_2^2$ or higher powers as polynomials in $x_3, \ldots, x_n$ and the $a_i$.
Since $F_3(x_3) = 0$ we can express $x_3^3$ and higher powers as polynomials in $x_4, x_5, \ldots, x_n$ and the $a_i$.
Introducing these expressions in $g(x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n)$ we see that we can express it as a polynomial in the $x_\nu$ and the $a_\nu$ such that the degree in $x_i$ is below $i$.
So $g(x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n)$ is a linear combination of the following $n!$ terms:
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:twGsi}
x_1^{\nu_1} x_2^{\nu_2} \cdots x_n^{\nu_n}
\quad
\text{where each $\nu_i \leq i-1$.}
\end{equation}
The coefficients of these terms are polynomials in the $a_i$.
Since the expressions \eqref{eq:twGsi} are linearly independent in $S$ (this is our previous result), the expression is unique.

This is a \emph{generalization} of the theorem of symmetric functions in its usual form.
The latter says that a symmetric polynomial can be written as a polynomial in $a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$.
Indeed, if $g(x_1, \ldots, x_n)$ is symmetric we have already an expression as linear combination of the terms \eqref{eq:twGsi} where only the term $1$ corresponding to $\nu_1 = \nu_2 = \cdots = \nu_n = 0$ has a coefficient $\not= 0$ in $S$, namely $g(x_1, \ldots, x_n)$.
So $g(x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n)$ is a polynomial in $a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$.

But our theorem gives an expression of any polynomial, symmetric or not.



\subsection{Normal extensions}

An extension field $E$ of $F$ is called a \emph{normal} extension if the group $G$ of automorphisms of $E$ which leave $F$ fixed has $F$ for its fixed field, and $(E/F)$ is finite.

Although the result in Theorem~\ref{theo:onth} cannot be sharpened in general, there is one case in which the equality sign will always occur, namely, in the case in which $\sigma_1, \sigma_2, \ldots, \sigma_n$ is a set of automorphisms which form a group.
We prove:

\begin{theo}
\label{theo:onfo}
If $\sigma_1, \sigma_2, \ldots, \sigma_n$ is a group of automorphisms of a field $E$ and if $F$ is the fixed field of $\sigma_1, \sigma_2, \ldots, \sigma_n$, then $(E/F) = n$.
\end{theo}

If $\sigma_1, \sigma_2, \ldots, \sigma_n$ is a group, then the identity occurs, say, $\sigma_1 = 1$.
The fixed field consists of those elements $x$ which are not moved by any of the $\sigma$'s, i.e., $\sigma_i(x) = x$, $i = 1,2,\ldots,n$.
Suppose that $(E/F) > n$.
Then there exist $n+1$ elements $\alpha_1, \alpha_2, \ldots, \alpha_{n+1}$ of $E$ which are linearly independent with respect to $F$.
By Theorem~\ref{theo:on}, there exists a non-trivial solution in $E$ to the system of equations
\begin{equation}
\tag{'}
\begin{aligned}
x_1 \sigma_1(\alpha_1) + 
x_2 \sigma_1(\alpha_2) + 
\cdots +
x_{n+1} \sigma_{1}(\alpha_{n+1}) &= 0
\\
x_1 \sigma_2(\alpha_1) + 
x_2 \sigma_2(\alpha_2) + 
\cdots +
x_{n+1} \sigma_{2}(\alpha_{n+1}) &= 0
\\
\cdots &
\\
x_1 \sigma_{n}(\alpha_1) + 
x_2 \sigma_{n}(\alpha_2) + 
\cdots +
x_{n+1} \sigma_{n}(\alpha_{n+1}) &= 0.
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}
We note that the solution cannot lie in $F$, otherwise, since $\sigma_1$ is the identity, the first equation would be a dependence between $\alpha_1, \ldots, \alpha_n$.

Among all non-trivial solutions $x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_{n+1}$ we choose one which has the least number of elements different from $0$.
We may suppose this solution to be $a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_r, 0, \ldots, 0$, where the first $r$ terms are different from $0$.
Moreover, $r\not=1$ because $a_1 \sigma_1(\alpha_1) = 0$ implies $a_1 = 0$ since $\sigma_1(\alpha_1) = \alpha_1 \not= 0$.
Also, we may suppose $a_r = 1$, since if we multiply the given solution by $a_r^{-1}$ we obtain a new solution in which the $r$-th term is $1$.
Thus, we have
\begin{equation}
\tag{$*$}
a_1 \sigma_{i}(\alpha_1) + 
a_2 \sigma_{i}(\alpha_2) + 
\cdots +
a_{r-1} \sigma_{i}(\alpha_{r-1}) +
\sigma_{i}(\alpha_{r}) = 0
\end{equation}
for $i = 1,2,\ldots,n$.
Since $a_1, \ldots, a_{r-1}$ cannot all belong to $F$, one of these, say $a_1$ is in $E$ but not in $F$.
There is an automorphism $\sigma_k$ for which $\sigma_k(\alpha_1) \not= a_1$.
If we use the fact that $\sigma_1, \sigma_2, \ldots, \sigma_n$ form a group, we see $\sigma_k \cdot \sigma_1, \sigma_k \cdot \sigma_2, \ldots, \sigma_k \cdots \sigma_n$ is a permutation of $\sigma_1, \sigma_2, \ldots, \sigma_n$.
Applying $\sigma_k$ to the expressions in $(*)$ we obtain
\begin{equation*}
\sigma_k(a_1) \sigma_k \sigma_{j}(\alpha_1) + 
\sigma_k(a_2) \sigma_k \sigma_{j}(\alpha_2) + 
\cdots +
\sigma_k(a_{r-1}) \sigma_k \sigma_{j}(\alpha_{r-1}) +
\sigma_k \sigma_{j}(\alpha_{r}) = 0
\end{equation*}
for $j=1,2,\ldots,n$, so that from $\sigma_k \sigma_j = \sigma_i$
\begin{equation}
\tag{$**$}
\sigma_k(a_1) \sigma_{i}(\alpha_1) + 
\sigma_k(a_2) \sigma_{i}(\alpha_2) + 
\cdots +
\sigma_k(a_{r-1}) \sigma_{i}(\alpha_{r-1}) +
\sigma_{i}(\alpha_{r}) = 0
\end{equation}
and if we subtract $(**)$ from $(*)$ we have
\begin{equation*}
(a_1 - \sigma_k(a_1)) \sigma_{i}(\alpha_1) + 
(a_2 - \sigma_k(a_2)) \sigma_{i}(\alpha_2) + 
\cdots +
(a_{r-1} - \sigma_k(a_{r-1})) \sigma_{i}(\alpha_{r-1}) = 0
\end{equation*}
which is a non-trivial solution to the system $(')$ having fewer than $r$ elements different from $0$, contrary to the choice of $r$.


\begin{coro}
\label{coro:on}
If $F$ is the fixed field for the finite group $G$, then each automorphism $\sigma$ that leaves $F$ fixed must belong to $G$.
\end{coro}

$(E/F) = \text{order of $G$} = n$.
Assume there is a $\sigma$ not in $G$.
Then $F$ would remain fixed under the $n+1$ elements consisting of $\sigma$ and the elements of $G$, thus contradicting the corollary to Theorem~\ref{theo:onth}.

\begin{coro}
\label{coro:tw}
There are no two finite group $G_1$ and $G_2$ with the same fixed field.
\end{coro}

This follows immediately from Corollary~\ref{coro:on}.
