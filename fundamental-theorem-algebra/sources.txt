If we know that real polynomials factor into products of polynomials of degree
at most 2, we can consider the real polynomial |p|^2 and write down a complex root of
one of its factors, which will necessarily be a root of p.

but it seems to only collect a couple of proofs and wants to develop the theory
leading to the proofs.
