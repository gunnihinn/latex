# The savage garden of curvature tensors

This is a something I'm writing with examples of curvature tensors of mostly Hermitian and Kahler metrics.

The notes include calculations of curvature tensors of well-known metrics. We try to stick to using the Chern connection to calculate the tensors, as I feel that this approach isn't represented in the literature.

## Plan

We've already calculated the curvature tensors of:

* Flat metrics (ha!)
* Metrics conformal to a given one
* Riemann surfaces
* The Fubini-Study metric on projective space
* The Hopf manifold

We'd like to also discuss:

* The Grassmannian
* Flag manifolds (they're Kahler, but some of them have a "natural" non-Kahler metric)
* The Iwasawa manifold
* Weil-Peterson metrics
* Curvature of direct images
* Hypersurfaces in projective space

I haven't decided how much background we want to include. Maybe it makes sense to have two parts; theory and practice? In _theory_ we'd define curvature tensors and maybe review vanishing theorems, structure theorems and Schwarz lemmas. In _practice_ we'd calculate a bunch of tensors.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! If you have a suggestion for a tensor to include, please let me know. Even better, if you've already calculated one and would like to include it and be a co-author, get in touch:
