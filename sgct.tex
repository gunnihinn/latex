Can prove that holomorphic bisectional curvature > 0 -> scalar curvature > 0.

\section{Conformal metrics}
\label{sec:org65fcbad}

Let \((E,h) \to X\) be a holomorphic Hermitian vector bundle, and let \(D\) be its Chern connection.

If \(f\) is a smooth real-valued function on \(X\), then \(h' := e^f h\) is again a Hermitian metric, \emph{conformal} to \(h\). The formulas for the Chern connection and curvature of conformal metrics are less complicated than the equivalent formulas for Riemannian metrics. We have
$$
h'(D_{h'} s, t) + h'(s, D_{h'} t)
= d h'(s, t)
= df \otimes h'(s, t) + h'(D_h s, t) + h'(s, D_h t).
$$
Writing \(df = \partial f + \bar\partial f\) we see that the Chern connection of \(h'\) is
$$
D_{h'} s = \partial f \otimes s + D_h s.
$$
Using the expressions for the covariant exterior derivative, we also have
\begin{align*}
D_{h'}^2 s
&= D_{h'}(\partial f \otimes s + D_h s)
\\
&= d(\partial f) \otimes s - \partial f \wedge D_{h'} s + D_{h'}(D_h s)
\\
&= -\partial\bar\partial f \otimes s - \partial f \wedge (\partial f \otimes s + D_h s) + \partial f \wedge D_h s + D_h^2 s
\\
&= -\partial\bar\partial f \otimes s + D_h^2 s.
\end{align*}

The Chern curvature of \(h'\) is thus
$$
D^2_{h'} = -\partial\bar\partial f \otimes \id_E + D^2_h.
$$

It's fun to work out what this gives for metrics conformal to a flat metric. We'll do that later when we study a particular metric on the \hyperref[sec:org8f5818e]{Hopf manifold}.

\paragraph{Conformal to K\"ahler is not K\"ahler}
\label{sec:org7b1cfdf}

It's worth mentioning that if \(h\) is a K\"ahler metric on a manifold of dimension \(n > 1\) and \(f\) is non-constant, then \(h'\) is not a K\"ahler metric. The reason is that if \(\omega\) is the symplectic form associated to \(h\), then the symplectic form of \(h'\) is \(e^f \omega\) and
$$
d(e^f \omega) = \omega \wedge (e^f df)
$$
and the linear morphism from one- to three-forms defined by wedging with the symplectic form \(\omega\) is injective. (The proof reduces to linear algebra by a calculation in local coordinates, either Darbeaux ones or in holomorphic ones that are orthonormal at a point. The hard Lefschetz theorem generalizes this to cohomology.)

\section{Flat metrics}
\label{sec:org504b250}

Let $(E,h) \to X$ be a holomorphic Hermitian vector bundle. The curvature form $\Theta$ of $h$ is a smooth section of $\bigwedge^{1,1}T_X \otimes \End E$. The simplest such section is of course the zero section. We say that the metric $h$ is \emph{flat} if its curvature form is zero.


\paragraph{Euclidean metric}

The prime example of such a metric is the standard Euclidean metric on any open set $U \subset \kk C^n$. The metric $h$ defined by the usual inner product,
$$
h(\xi, \eta) = \sum_{j=1}^n \xi_j \overline{\eta_j}.
$$
The associated K\"ahler form is
$$
\omega = \sum_{j=1}^n \frac{i}{2} dz_j \wedge d\bar z_j.
$$
This is clearly $d$-closed, so the Euclidean metric is K\"ahler.\footnote{It has a global potential $\|z\|^2$. This is seldom useful.} We have
$$
h(D\xi, \eta) + h(\xi, D\eta)
= d h(\xi, \eta)
= \sum_{j=1}^n d\xi_j \otimes \overline{\eta_j} + \xi_j \otimes \overline{d\eta_j}
$$
so the Chern connection of $h$ is equal to the exterior derivative.

% TODO: Is any of the following relevant to examples of curvature tensors?
% Do we want to only do examples or also have a review of some things that are known about curvature?

\paragraph{Compact manifolds}

There are also compact manifolds with flat metrics. Let $\Lambda \subset \kk C^n$ be a lattice, that is, an abelian group of rank $2n$. Then $X := \kk C^n / \Lambda$ is a compact complex manifold, called a \emph{complex torus}. As $\Lambda$ acts by translations on $\kk C^n$, it preserves the Euclidean metric, which descends to $X$.

One can ask whether the converse holds: If $X$ is a compact complex manifold with a flat metric, then is $X$ a complex torus?

The answer is subtle. First, the proposed answer cannot be true, as some complex tori admit subgroups that act freely, and whose quotients are thus again compact complex manifolds with flat metrics that are not tori. In the K\"ahler case, that is the extent of the problems that can arise. We can see this quickly if we're prepared to nuke a mosquito:

Suppose $X$ is a compact K\"ahler manifold that admits a flat metric. All of its Chern classes are then zero, in particular the first one. By \cite{beauville1983}, the universal covering of $X$ splits into a product of $\kk C^n$ and compact manifolds with zero first Chern class. The vanishing of all Chern classes of $X$ implies the product only involves $\kk C^n$.

For Hermitian manifolds, the answer is slightly more complicated: A flat Hermitian manifold is covered by a simply connected complex Lie group~\cite{boothby1958}.


\paragraph{Gauss--Manin}

% TODO: I'm not sure this should be here at all.

Let $\pi : X \to S$ be a family of compact K\"ahler manifolds over a connected smooth base $S$. All of the manifolds $X_s := \pi^{-1}(s)$ in the family are diffeomorphic, so they all have isomorphic cohomology groups $H^k(X_s, \kk Z)$. These can be assembled into a holomorphic vector bundle $E \to S$ (by taking direct images of constant sheaves) whose fibers are exactly
$$
E_s = H^k(X_s, \kk C).
$$
The construction also yields a connection $\nabla$ on this vector bundle, called the \emph{Gauss--Manin connection}. It is flat, and if $\alpha$ is a local section of $E$ and $Y \subset X_s$ a $2k$-dimensional submanifold, then
$$
d \! \int_{X_s}\!\!\!\! \alpha = \int_{X_s} \!\!\! \nabla \alpha.
$$
The Gauss--Manin connection is generally not the Chern connection of a metric on $E$.

Something mildly interesting happens in the middle cohomology. Suppose the manifolds in the family are of dimension $n$. Then there is an intersection form on $n$-forms, which yields a sesquilinear form
$$
b(\alpha, \beta) = \int_{X_s} i^{n^2} \alpha \wedge \overline{\beta}.
$$
This form is non-degenerate, but has mixed signature. One can still define connections for such forms, and the usual proof of the existance and uniqueness of the Chern connection carries through for them. One can check that the Gauss--Manin connection is the Chern connection of the intersection form in this sense. This does not appear to have any applications.


\section{Projective space}
\label{sec:orgcfabeed}

Might be fun to do in different ways. Local coordinates, more globally.

The complex projective space is the space of lines in a given complex vector space. That is, if $V$ is a complex vector space, then
$$
\kk P(V) := \{ v \in V \mid v \not= 0 \} / \kk C^*,
$$
where $\kk C^*$ acts by multiplication. By convention we write $\kk P^n := \kk P(\kk C^{n+1})$.\footnote{Some people insist on writing $\kk C \kk P^n$ to distinguish between fields. As a better woman than I once said, we're doing geometry so we'll work over $\kk C$. In that case there's little to distinguish from.}

There is a holomorphic projection map $\pi : V \setminus \{0\} \to \kk P(V)$. If we consider the trivial vector bundle $V \to \kk P(V)$, then the definition of projective space gives a line bundle $\cc O(-1) \subset V$ whose fiber over a point $[v]$ is the line $\kk C \cdot v$. This line bundle is holomorphic.

Fix a Hermitian inner product $h$ on $V$. This defines a flat Hermitian metric on the trivial vector bundle $V \to \kk P(V)$. It follows that the induced metric on $\cc O(-1)$ is non-positive.\footnote{Hence the $-1$.}

The usual charts on $\kk P^n$ are of the form
$$
U_j = \{[z_0 : \cdots : z_n] \in \kk P^{n} \mid z_j \not= 0\}
$$
and we have isomorphisms $U_j \to \kk C^n$ defined by
$$
[z_0 : \cdots : z_n] \mapsto (z_0/z_j, \ldots, \widehat{z_j/z_j}, \ldots, z_n/z_j).
$$

Let $\lambda \in V^* \setminus \{0\}$ and define $U_\lambda = \{ [v] \in \kk P(V) \mid \lambda(v) \not= 0 \}$. If we try to define a map on $U_\lambda$ by setting $[v] \mapsto v / \lambda(v)$, where does it take its values? In $V$? Actually in an affine hyperplane $H_\lambda = \{v \in V \mid \lambda(v) = 1 \}$. That has the right dimension and the map is clearly surjective.

On $H_\lambda$, we have a section $s$ of $\cc O(-1)$ given by $s(v) = v$. This is just the Euler section $\xi$. The curvature form of the line bundle is then
$$
i \partial \bar\partial \log h(\xi, \xi)
= i\partial \frac{h(\xi, \partial \xi)}{h(\xi, \xi)}
= \frac{i h(\partial \xi, \partial \xi)}{h(\xi, \xi)}
- i\frac{h(\partial \xi, \xi)}{h(\xi, \xi)} \wedge \frac{h(\xi, \partial \xi)}{h(\xi, \xi)}.
$$
The Euler field satisfies $\partial_u \xi = u$ for holomorphic vector fields $u$. The $(1,1)$-form defined by the curvature form is then
$$
\omega(\alpha, \beta)
= \frac{h(\alpha, \beta)}{h(\xi, \xi)}
- \frac{h(\alpha, \xi)}{h(\xi, \xi)} \cdot \frac{h(\xi, \beta)}{h(\xi, \xi)}.
$$
We claim that this is positive-definite. We have
\begin{align*}
  \omega(\alpha, \alpha)
&= \frac{h(\alpha, \alpha)}{h(\xi, \xi)}
- \frac{|h(\alpha, \xi)|^2}{h(\xi, \xi)^2}
\\
&\geq \frac{h(\alpha, \alpha)}{h(\xi, \xi)}
- \frac{h(\alpha, \alpha) h(\xi, \xi)}{h(\xi, \xi)^2}
= 0
\end{align*}
with equality if and only if $\alpha$ is a multiple of the Euler field $\xi$. Why can't that happen? The section $\alpha$ has to be tangent to $H_\lambda$, which means it satisfies $\lambda(\alpha) = 0$. But we've defined our $H_\lambda$ so that $\lambda(\xi) = 1$.

\label{sec:orga0ef6a0}

These are K\"ahler. There is a ``natural'' non-K\"ahler metric on them.

\section{Hopf manifold}
\label{sec:org8f5818e}

Let \(\lambda \in \kk C\) be a complex number such that \(0 < |\lambda| < 1\). The \emph{Hopf manifold} is the quotient
$$
X := (\kk C^n \setminus \{0\}) / \Gamma,
$$
where \(\Gamma \cong \kk Z\) is the group generated by \(\lambda\) that acts by
$$
\lambda \cdot (z_1, \ldots, z_n) = (\lambda z_1, \ldots, \lambda z_n).
$$
The Hopf manifold is compact and is diffeomorphic to \(S^{2n-1} \times S^1\). In particular,
$$
H^2(X, \kk C) \cong H^2(S^{2n-1}, \kk C) \oplus H^1(S^{2n-1}, \kk C) \otimes H^1(S^1, \kk C) = 0,
$$
so it is not K\"ahler.

Let \(\pi : \kk C^n \setminus \{0\} \to X\) be the projection. If \(\omega\) is a Hermitian metric on \(X\), then its pullback \(\pi^*\omega\) is a Hermitian metric on \(\kk C^n \setminus \{0\}\) that is invariant under the action of \(\Gamma\). If we write it as \(\pi^*\omega = \sum_{j,k} a_{jk}(z) \tfrac{i}{2} dz_j \wedge d\bar z_k\), then the smooth functions \(a_{jk}\) must satisfy
$$
a_{jk}(\lambda z) = \frac{1}{|\lambda|^2} a_{jk}(z).
$$
We can pick one such metric to inspect; we'll choose \(\omega = \frac{1}{\|z\|^2} \omega_{\mathrm{std}}\), that is, a metric that is conformal to the standard metric on \(\kk C^n \setminus \{0\}\). The Ph.D. thesis \cite{istrati:tel-02156198} has a nice discussion of the history of these metrics on the Hopf manifold.

As the metric is conformal to a K\"ahler metric, and the conformal factor is non-constant, the metric is not K\"ahler. (We already knew this because \emph{no} metric on the Hopf manifold is K\"ahler, but it's nice to check.)


\paragraph{Curvature tensor}
\label{sec:org96d544d}

We've \hyperref[sec:org65fcbad]{already computed} the curvature of a conformal metric, so we know the curvature form of this metric is
$$
D^2 s = i\partial\bar\partial \log \|z\|^2 \otimes s.
$$
Let's compute this and express the curvature tensor of the metric. We have
$$
\bar\partial \log \|z\|^2
= \frac{1}{\|z\|^2} \sum_{k=1}^n z_k \bar\partial z_k
$$
and
$$
i\partial\bar\partial \log \|z\|^2
= - \frac{i}{\|z\|^4} \biggl(\sum_{j=1}^n \bar z_j \partial z_j \biggr) \wedge \biggl(\sum_{k=1}^n z_k \bar\partial z_k\biggr) + \frac{1}{\|z\|^2} \sum_{j=1}^n i\partial z_j \wedge \bar\partial z_j.
$$
We can try to write this in a more global way by looking at the Euler vector field
$$
\xi = \sum_{j=1}^n z_j \frac{\partial}{\partial z_j}.
$$
Then
$$
i\partial\bar\partial \log \|z\|^2
= -\frac{4}{\|z\|^4} \langle \cdot, \xi \rangle \wedge \langle \xi, \cdot \rangle + \frac{2}{\|z\|^2} \langle \cdot, \cdot \rangle.
$$
The curvature tensor of the metric \(h\) on the Hopf manifold is then
$$
R(\alpha,\beta,\gamma,\delta)
= 2 h(\alpha, \beta)\,h(\gamma, \delta) - 4 h(\alpha, \xi)\, h(\xi, \beta)\,h(\gamma, \delta).
$$
We note that it has the expected conjugate symmetries, that is, that \(R(\beta, \alpha, \delta, \gamma) = \overline{R(\alpha, \beta, \gamma, \delta)}\), but \(R(\gamma, \delta, \alpha, \beta) \not= R(\alpha, \beta, \gamma, \delta)\) like it would if this were the curvature tensor of a K\"ahler metric.


\paragraph{Holomorphic sectional curvature}
\label{sec:org6471503}

The holomorphic sectional curvature of the Hopf manifold is
\begin{align*}
H(\alpha)
= \frac{1}{\|\alpha\|^4} R(\alpha, \alpha, \alpha, \alpha)
&= \frac{1}{\|\alpha\|^4} \bigl( 2 \|\alpha\|^4 - 4 |h(\alpha, \xi)|^2 \|\alpha\|^2 \bigr)
\\
&\geq \frac{1}{\|\alpha\|^4}\bigl( 2 \|\alpha\|^4 - 4 \|\alpha\|^4\bigr)
= -2,
\end{align*}
where the inequality is by Cauchy--Schwarz and that \(\|\xi\|^2 = 1\) for the metric \(h\). By dropping the negative term we get an easy upper bound as well, and see that
$$
-2 \leq H(\alpha) \leq 2.
$$
Both of these bounds are sharp, as one is acheived when \(\alpha\) is a multiple of \(\xi\) and the other when \(\alpha\) is orthogonal to \(\xi\). By the intermediate value theorem, the holomorphic sectional curvature also assumes any value in between the two.


\paragraph{Ricci tensors}
\label{sec:org3942125}

The curvature tensor can be contracted in three ways to obtain a \((1,1)\)-form. On a K\"ahler manifold, all three ways give the same result; on a non-K\"ahler manifold they may not.

The easiest of these to compute for us is the one given by taking the traces of the endomorphisms in the curvature form. As those endomorphisms are the identity here, we find that
$$
r_1(\alpha, \beta)
= 2n \bigl( h(\alpha, \beta) - 2 h(\alpha, \xi) \, h(\xi, \beta) \bigr).
$$
This is the same as we obtain by contracting the curvature tensor along \(\delta\) and \(\gamma\). As before, Cauchy--Schwarz gives us the estimates
$$
-2n
\leq \frac{r_1(\alpha, \alpha)}{\|\alpha\|^2}
\leq 2n
$$
which are sharp under the same conditions as before. As expected, this form is neither positive- nor negative-definite: It is the curvature form of the anti-canonical bundle on \(X\) when equipped with the metric induced by \(\omega\). If it were positive or negative, \(X\) would be projective.

Our second contraction is along \(\alpha\) and \(\beta\). The only relevant part of the curvature tensor we don't know how to contract is \(h(\alpha, \xi)h(\xi, \beta)\). Let \((\zeta_1, \ldots, \zeta_n)\) be a local holomorphic frame that's orthonormal at a point \(z\) we care about. We have
$$
\sum_{j=1}^n h(\zeta_j, \xi) h(\xi, \zeta_j) = h(\xi, \xi) = 1
$$
as \(\xi = \sum_{j=1}^n h(\xi, \zeta_j) \zeta_j\) and \(h(\xi,\xi) = 1\).
Then
$$
r_2(\gamma, \delta)
= 2n h(\gamma, \delta) - 4 h(\gamma, \delta)
= 2(n-2) h(\gamma, \delta).
$$
This form is not only different from \(r_1\) but it has a sign: when \(n = 2\) it is identically zero, and when \(n > 2\) it is positive-definite.

The third contraction is along \(\beta\) and \(\gamma\). We let \((\zeta_1, \ldots, \zeta_n)\) be a local holomorphic frame that's orthonormal at a point \(z\) as before. We have
$$
\sum_{j=1}^n h(\alpha, \zeta_j) h(\zeta_j, \delta)
= h(\alpha, \delta).
$$
Also
$$
\sum_{j=1}^n h(\alpha, \xi) h(\xi, \zeta_j) h(\zeta_j, \delta)
= h(\alpha, \xi) \sum_{j=1}^n  h(\xi, \zeta_j) h(\zeta_j, \delta)
= h(\alpha, \xi) h(\xi, \delta).
$$
Together, we get
$$
r_3(\alpha, \delta)
= 2 h(\alpha, \delta) - 4 h(\alpha, \xi) h(\xi, \delta)
= \frac{1}{n} r_1(\alpha, \delta).
$$

\paragraph{Scalar curvature}
\label{sec:orgf9212d2}

We can contract any of the Ricci-forms we got to obtain the scalar curvature of the Hopf manifold. Picking the first two, we get
$$
s = 2n(n-2),
$$
while picking the third gives \(1/n\) times that. We see that the Hopf surface has identically zero scalar curvature, while the higher-dimensional Hopf manifolds have positive constant scalar curvature.

\section{Intuitive explanation for curvature forms}
\label{sec:org2b43ecb}

Wikipedia has a handwavy explanation of curvature as what happens when we parallel transport a section along a parallelogram. Can we make this precise?


\section{Riemann surfaces}
\label{sec:org776713b}

In Riemannian geometry, the full curvature tensor doesn't appear until in dimension $4$. Before that, the low dimensions of the tangent space restrict what tensors can appear. The equivalent situation in complex geometry only occurs in complex dimension one, one Riemann surfaces. Complex dimension two is real dimension four and already contains all the complexities of the higher dimensions. Conversely, complex dimension one is only real dimension two and too simple to give a good idea of what happens in higher dimensions.

\paragraph{Everything is K\"ahler}
Let $U \subset \kk C$ be an open set. We can imagine it is a small neighborhood around a point in a Riemann surface we care about. Let $h$ be a Hermitian metric on $U$. The K\"ahler form of the metric can be written as
$$
\omega = e^{f(z)} \frac{i}{2} dz \wedge d\bar z
$$
on $U$. Then $d\omega = 0$ for dimensional reasons, so any Hermitian metric on $U$ is K\"ahler.

\paragraph{Curvature}
By the above, we also have $h = e^f h_{\mathrm{std}}$, so the Chern connection and curvature of the metric can be deduced from our discussion on conformal metrics. Notably, the curvature form is
$$
\Theta
= i\partial\bar\partial f
= \frac{2}{e^f}\frac{\partial^2f}{\partial z \partial \bar z} \; e^f \frac{i}{2} dz \wedge d\bar z
= 2\Delta_\omega f \; \omega.
$$
There should be a tensor product with the identity map on $T_X$ in the first equality, but the identity map on a one-dimensional space is just multiplication by $1$ so we can skip it.

One can note that an endomorphism on a one-dimensional space can be identified with its trace. From that point of view, one can say that the curvature form in complex dimension one can be identified with the form one gets by taking the trace of the curvature endomorphisms. In some sense, the full curvature form collapses to the Ricci form. In some other sense, the above computations imply the Ricci form only contains the scalar curvature. There's not enough space for complex curvature tensors.
