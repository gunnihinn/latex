# The little book of Kahler geometry

Stuff I'm interested in, done in as an invariant style as possible.

Can we start by stating things invariantly?

- Sub- and quotient bundles
- Projective spaces and Grassmannians
- No pullback metric on a blow-up is positive
- Global metrics on families, start with Weil-Petersson on curves
- Projective bundles, maybe via Hermitian forms
- Curvature of Nakano-positive metrics [1]
